eIDISCLAIMER:e@

FMA is not warranted.  The user uses FMA at his or her own risk.
Network users must check with the Network System Manager before
installing and using FMA.


eIINTRODUCTION:e@

The FMA program provides the Corvus Concept user with an easy to
use file management utility.  Using FMA, the user can perform the
most common file maintenance operations in and between volumes on
the network and local drives.

The general concepts of the program are:

      a.  to provide on a single screen a complete file directory
          of a selected volume and a directory of the user's volumes
          with as much status information as possible,

      b.  to eliminate the need to type volume names and filenames
          when performing common file operations,

      c.  and to leave the users Concept in a graceful state
          when FMA is exited and or when errors are encountered.


The user should be familiar with the Corvus Concept and have a
general understanding of the operating system and file structure
before using the FMA program.  New users should read "The Corvus
Concept Personal Workstation User Guide" before using FMA.




eIREQUIREMENTS:e@

To use FMA, the Corvus Concept Operating System, CCOS (ver 1.2a)
must be correctly installed to the network or local drive and the
user must have READ access to volumes CCSYS, CCUTIL and ISYS.  The
System Manager should install FMA and HELP.FMA.TEXT to the CCSYS
volume so that FMA can be accessed by all users.

FMA does require that file names and volume names comply with the
Operating System requirements, ref the Workstation User Guide.
