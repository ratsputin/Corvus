      The driver maintains an Auto LineFeed flag.  If the flag is set
and the mode unitwrite parameter is zero (0) then the driver will put
a LineFeed character into the character stream after a Carraige
Return character.  If the mode parameter is non-zero or the Auto
LineFeed flag is clear then no LineFeed character will be added.
