eIDISCLAIMER:e@

FMA is not warranted.  The user uses FMA at his or her own risk.
Network users must check with the Network System Manager before
installing and using FMA.


eIINTRODUCTION:e@

The FMA program provides the Corvus Concept user with an easy to
use file management utility.  Using FMA, the user can perform the
most common file maintenance operations in and between volumes on
the network and local drives.

The general concepts of the program are:

      a.  to provide on a single screen a complete file directory
          of a selected volume and a directory of the user's volumes
          with as much status information as possible,

      b.  to eliminate the need to type volume names and filenames
          when performing common file operations,

      c.  and to leave the users Concept in a graceful state
          when FMA is exited and or when errors are encountered.


The user should be familiar with the Corvus Concept and have a
general understanding of the operating system and file structure
before using the FMA program.  New users should read "The Corvus
Concept Personal Workstation User Guide" before using FMA.




eIREQUIREMENTS:e@

To use FMA, the Corvus Concept Operating System, CCOS (ver 1.2a)
must be correctly installed to the network or local drive and the
user must have READ access to volumes CCSYS, CCUTIL and ISYS.  The
System Manager should install FMA and HELP.FMA.TEXT to the CCSYS
volume so that FMA can be accessed by all users.

FMA does require that file names and volume names comply with the
Operating System requirements, ref the Workstation User Guide.


eICONVENTIONS:e@


UPPERCASE - LOWERCASE -

All keyboard entries may be entered in upper or lowercase.


.PG

                         FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 3



CONVENTIONS cont.


Type, Press and [RETURN] -

Throughout this guide the word 'Type' is used to mean that
two or more characters are to be entered from the keyboard.
The word 'Press' is used to indicate that a single letter,
number or label is to be entered from the keyboard. The
[RETURN] symbol means the Return or Enter key should be pressed.



EXIT -

The general convention to exit operations within FMA is to
press the ESCape, BREAK or F10 function key.  Which key is
effective depends upon the specific operation.


ARROW KEYS -

The four arrow keys are used to position the cursor in the
File and Volume directories.



FILE DIRECTORY WINDOW -

The larger window, located in the upper left portion of the
screen, in which is displayed the volume attributes and the
file directory.



VOLUME DIRECTORY WINDOW -

This smaller window, located either below or to the right of the
File Directory Window, displays a directory of the user's volumes.
An overview status of each volume is indicated; Read/Write or
Read/Only, the number of open Read/Write blocks at the end of the
volume, and the number of files currently in the volume.

Should two volumes have the same name, only the volume that is
mounted to the lowest unit number is read and the other volume,
with the duplicate name, cannot be accessed unless one of the two
volumes is renamed, see Rename Volume (RenamVol).

CONVENTIONS cont:


COMMAND WINDOW -

The Command Window is located above the Function Key Labels and
usually displays a prompt for user input.  Also displayed in
the Command Window are some status messages and error messages.


INVERSE WINDOW -

This window is opened to display program progress during several
FMA operations.  The window overlays a portion of the File
Directory Window and may display additional user prompts and or
error messages.


FUNCTION KEYS & LABELS -

The Function Keys, labeled on the keyboard from F1 to F10, are
associated with the ten Function Labels displayed along the
lower portion of the screen.


eIUSING FMA - Operational Overview:e@

Assuming the FMA program has been transferred to the CCSYS volume
or to the users current volume, and a 'Select Function:' prompt
is displayed in the Command Window, then Type FMA [RETURN].

FMA is read into the users Concept, the FMA window environment is
established, the /CCUTIL/CSD.07.11.ALT character set is loaded
and all* volume directories that the user has access to are read.


  * Note:  FMA will not - cannot read the volume directory of a
           volume if its volume name is identical to another
           volume that has been mounted on a lower numbered unit.

           This condition usually occurs when a user has access
           to network volumes and local volumes (on a local drive).
           Access to volumes, with identical names, can usually be
           controlled by the selection of Local or Omninet boot.



If the user has one or more floppy drives installed, FMA will
check each drive and attempt to identify and read the directory
of the floppy.  The time required for FMA to initialize can be
improved by keeping a disk in each drive.
.PG

                       FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 5

USING FMA cont.

Once the FMA initialization process is complete, FMA displays
the File Directory Window, Volume Directory Window and a set
of FILE MAINTENANCE LABELS.  At this point, the file directory
displayed is the user's current volume.

  The FILE MAINTENANCE LABELS are:


            F1         F2         F3         F4        F5
          Vol Dir   ConcFile   AlphaDir   Del-Temp*  Spool
          SetFLAG   UndoFLAG   ViewFile   Set Vol    Crunch*


             F6          F7        F8         F9        F10
         LocPrint**   RENAME*   DELETE*    FindFile    Help
          Clock        Calc     CopyFile   Run Pgms    Exit



    * These labels are not displayed if the current volume is
      READ/ONLY access.

   ** This label is not displayed unless the printer port has
      been set; see Workstation User Guide.


   The functional operation of each label is explained in detail
   in the section titled LABEL DEFINITIONS.

To display another file directory, the user must move the cursor
to the Volume Directory, Press [Vol Dir].  The cursor is positioned
to unit #4, CCSYS in the Volume Directory and a new set of VOLUME
LABELS are displayed.

  The VOLUME LABELS are:

        F3        F4               F7               F10
       (List)   (Reset)          RenamVol          Help
      New Vol   Vol Dir                            Exit


By using the up & down arrow keys, the user may position the cursor
to a volume name and Press [(List) New Vol] (shifted or un-shifted).
FMA will then display the file directory of the selected volume and
redisplay the FILE MAINTENANCE LABELS.

NOTE: When the monitor is in the landscape orientation, pressing the
      right arrow key will also move the cursor to the right and into
      the Volume Directory.  In the landscape mode, the left arrow
      key  (and the up  arrow key from the page mode) will return
      the cursor from the Volume Directory to the File Directory.

                       FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 6


USING FMA cont:


The actions implied by the labels are accomplished by either
pressing a function key label or by first positioning the cursor,
using the arrow keys, to the desired filename and pressing the
[Set Flag] key.  (A visual indicator of a 'set flag' is the symbol
'>' next to the filename.  To remove a 'set flag', position the
cursor using the arrow keys to the flag and Press [UndoFlag] key.
Multiple flags maybe set.)  The file maintenance action is then
initiated on the 'flagged files' by pressing the appropriate
function key.


eILABEL DEFINITIONS - FILE MAINTENANCE LABELSe@


eASet Flage@  (F1 unSHIFTed)

  Pressing this key places the visual indicator '>' or 'flag'
  along side the filename at the current cursor position.  The
  cursor then steps to the next filename.

  The number of bolcks contained in the flagged files are totaled
  at the bottom of the File Directory Window along with a count
  of the number of files flagged.


eAVol Dire@  (F1 SHIFTed)

  This label means Volume Directory and is used to move the
  cursor (and program control) from the File Directory to the
  Volume Directory.


eAUndoFlage@  (F2 unSHIFTed)

  This function key is used to remove flags from the File
  Directory.  Note that holding the key depressed will step
  the cursor through the complete directory, clearing all flags.

  As flags are removed the totals for blocks and files flagged,
  at the bottom of the window, are kept current.


eAConcFilee@  (F2 SHIFTed)

  This label means Concatenate Files and is used to combine two
  or more files, of the same type (TEXT or DATA), into one
  continuous file.  Also, this label can be used to make a copy
  of a single file, within the same volume, with a different file
  name.

.PG

                          FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 7

ConcFile cont.


  First set flags assuring that text and data files are not mixed
  and then Press [ConcFile].

  The labels are turned off and the user is prompted for a file
  name.  FMA checks the new name and will reject incorrect
  entries, see Workstation User Guide.

  FMA then presents a prompt to select a destination volume for
  the concatenated files.  The cursor appears at the top of the
  Volume Directory and the F3 label reads TARGET.  Position the
  cursor to the desired destination volume name and Press
  [TARGET]. The selected volume must have READ/WRITE access.

  FMA checks the destination volume for the presence of the new
  file name, if a duplicate file name is found the user is
  alerted that to proceed will overwrite the existing file.

  FMA also checks the destination volume for available directory
  space (two entries must be available) and adequate available
  blocks.

  FMA generates an Exec-File in the destination volume to perform
  the concatenate files operation.  The system File Manager
  utility is used to concatenate the first file with the second,
  then the volume is crunched and the third file is concatenated
  to the combined first and second files.  This cycle continues
  until all flagged files are concatenated into one file.


eAViewFilee@  (F3 unSHIFTed)

  This label is used to list '.TEXT' files to the screen.  If no
  files are flagged, FMA attempts to list the file at the current
  cursor position.

  Pressing any key will stop and start the screen scrolling. Press
  ESC to immediately return to the File Directory Window.

eAAlphaDir - Norm Dire@  (F3 SHIFTed)

  Pressing the [AlphaDir] function key presents the filenames in
  the File Directories in alphabetical order.  The label [Norm Dir]
  replaces the [AlphaDir] label, when pressed this label returns
  the order of the filenames as they actually appear in the volume.


eASet Vole@  (F4 unSHIFTed)

  This function label sets the volume currently being displayed
  in the File Directory Window to the current volume by using the
  system File Manager utility.

.PG

                     FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 8


eADel-Tempe@  (F4 SHIFTed)

  Temporary files are indicated in the File Directory with the
  blocks in inverse video.  To delete the temporary files set
  flags and Press [Del-Temp].  The system File Manager utility
  provides 'delete file (Y N) ?' prompts in the Inverse Window
  for each flagged file.

  This function label is not displayed if the volume is READ/ONLY.


eACrunch  e@(F5 unSHIFTed)

  This function label moves files in the volume currently being
  displayed in the File Directory Window so that all unused space
  is combined at the end of the volume.  This operation is
  performed by the system File Manager and the activity is
  displayed in the Inverse Window.

  This function label is not displayed if the volume is READ/ONLY.


eASpoole@  (F5 SHIFTed)

  Pressing this label spools flagged files to pipes named PRINTER.
  FMA uses the /CCSYS/SPOOL (version 4.0) program and presets the
  parameter LINEFEED to NO.  This FMA operation is intended for
  use with text files only.



eACalce@  (F6 unSHIFTed)

  Pressing this label calls the /ISYS/CC.CALC program.  The desk
  calculator runs in a full window.  To exit CC.CALC Press [Main].


eALocPrinte@  (F6 SHIFTed)

  This function label provides local printer support for Diablo
  type printers.  Specifically the Diablo Model 620 SPI printer
  does not support 'auto enhanced' character printing but can
  be host controlled.  This utility implements the Diablo printer
  control codes to support selected EDWORD enhancements, Bold,
  Underline,  Bold  with  Underline  and  Double-Underline. The
  Double-Underline is printed as Underline.

  The LocPrint function label is not displayed unless the printer
  port has been set, see Workstation User Guide.

  The use of Printer Action Tables is not recommended with the
  FMA printer utility.  This is because FMA is HOST control of a
  printer (character by character) and Printer Action Tables
  provide only translation of the enhancement switches.

.PG

                        FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 9


LocPrint cont.

  This function is also compatible with the Diablo Model 630, all
  serial interface or API versions, and should be compatible with
  the many printers that use the Diablo standard control codes.

  Set flags at text files to print or move the cursor to a single
  file to print and Press [LocPrint].  The screen will then display
  the following:





    PRINTER UTILITY...for EDWORD enhanced .TEXT files
            Support for DIABLO SYSTEMS type printers.

            Printer Action Tables not recommended with this utility

            TURN-ON LOCAL PRINTER....AND LOAD PAPER
            SET PAPER TO "TOP OF FORM"

          ENTER:     1  for CONTINOUS FORM FEED
                     2  for SINGLE SHEET, pause to change paper
                     3  for CONTINOUS FORM without ENHANCEMENTS
                     4  for SINGLE SHEET without ENHANCEMENTS
                     5  to change form length to 8.5 inches
                     6  to Quit





     Selections 1 and 2 provide enhanced text as described above.

     Selections 3 and 4 strip enhancements and is provided for
                        incompatible printers and to print files
                        where the EDWORD enhancements are
                        incorrectly set.

     Selection number 5 toggles between 8.5 and 11 form length.

     Selection number 6 returns user to the main FMA screen.




  DOT Commands:  The LocPrint function only detects and manages
                 the '.PG' page break dot command.  No other Dot
                 commands are supported.


.PG

                        FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 10


LocPrint cont.


  FORMAT: The LocPrint function is designed to strip the first 4
          blank lines from text files.  If EDWORD is used to
          format a text file, it inserts 4 blank lines after each
          .PG command that it inserts.  This feature provides the
          ability to position the paper in the printer at the
          first line to be printed.

          If the .PG command is not found by the 58th line
          printed (or by the 43rd line when set for 8.5 inch form
          length)  LocPrint function inserts a page break.  Note,
          Diablo printers default to 6 lines per inch.




eAClocke@  (F7 unSHIFTed)

  Pressing this label calls the /ISYS/CC.CLOCK program.  The clock
  program runs in a full window.  To exit CC.Clock Press [Main].


eARenamee@  (F7 SHIFTed)

  This function label is used to rename files.  Set flags at the
  files to be renamed or position the cursor to a single file and
  Press [Rename].  The user is then prompted for a new file name.
  The new file name is checked for correctness and compared to
  filenames already present in the volume.  The new filename is
  then written to the volume directory and the prompt is repeated
  for the next flagged file.

  This function label is not displayed if the volume is READ/ONLY.


eACopyFilee@  (F8 UnSHIFTed)

  This function label is used to copy files from the currently
  displayed File Directory to another volume that has READ/WRITE
  access.  Set flags at files to be copied.  Note the number of
  blocks and number of files flagged are totaled in the lower
  portion of the window. Press [CopyFile].

  FMA then presents a prompt to select a destination volume for
  the files to be copied.  The cursor appears at the top of the
  Volume Directory and the F3 label reads TARGET.  Position the
  cursor to the desired destination volume name and Press
  [TARGET]. The selected volume must have READ/WRITE access and
  should not be the currently displayed volume.

  FMA checks the destination volume for READ/WRITE access, available
  directory space and adequate available blocks.
.PG

                    FILE MANAGEMENT AID - USER GUIDE page 11


CopyFile cont.


  Control is then passed to the system File Manager utility to
  copy the flagged files to the destination volume.  Progress is
  displayed in the Inverse Window along with any required prompts.


eADELETEe@  (F8 SHIFTed)

  This function label is used to remove (delete) files from the
  currently displayed File Directory.  Set flags at the filenames
  to be removed and Press [DELETE].

  In the Inverse Window the system File Manager will present a
  prompt for each file to be deleted.

  This function label is not displayed if the volume is READ/ONLY.


eARunPgmse@  (F9 unSHIFTed)

  This function label is used to run programs from the FMA File
  Directory Window.  Set flags at the filenames of the programs
  or position the cursor to a single program and Press [RunPgms].

  The flagged programs are run in the full screen window.  If
  non program files are flagged the run programs operation will
  generate a non fatal error message and return control to the
  File Directory Window.


eAFindFilee@  (F9 SHIFTed)

  This function label is used to locate files.  Press [FindFile],
  a prompt is presented in the Inverse Window to enter a file
  name.  The user may enter a specific file name or an ambiguous
  filename by using WILD CARDS.

  The volume directories are searched for the requested file(s).

  Note the search is of the record of the directories as they
  were at FMA initialization.  If files have been deleted, renamed
  or copied prior to using FindFile, a search for those files will
  be invalid.  Use the [(Reset) VolDir] function, from the Volume
  Labels, to re-establish a current record of the directories.

  If the requested file is found, the File Directory of the lowest
  numbered volume that contains the file is displayed.  The file
  name of the requested file is displayed in inverse video.  All of
  the volume names containing the requested file are presented in
  inverse video.

eIFMA ERROR MESSAGES:e@

  FMA checks most IO (input - output) operations for an acceptable
  completion indicator, IOresult, from the Corvus Concept Operating
  System.  If the operating system indicates an error and if FMA is
  programmed to handle it, the error message will be displayed in
  the form ' message   ..Source Ref XX'.

  The  '..Source Ref XX' (where XX is numeric) is a reference key to
  the FMA source that initiated the test for the error condition.
  This feature is provided to facilitate evaluation and debugging.

  The Following is a list of the possible IO error messages.

                     Parity or CRC Error         ..Source Ref  XX
                     Invalid Device number       ..Source Ref  XX

  FMA also provides a second set of error messages that are detected
  by checks witin FMA.  These error messages are prefixed with FMA,
  example  'FMA - Error - message'.

  A third type of error message maybe encountered, these messages
  are generated by the operating system utility (such as CC.FILMGR)
  that has control during some FMA operations.

  The above error conditions (usually) are not fatal to FMA.

eIBUG REPORTS:e@

  Should you encounter fatal errors (where FMA stops or the system
  hangs), please verify that your CCOS is installed  correctly and
  the network is functionally sound.

  Report 'bugs' with a complete description of the conditions and
  the actions that caused the problem.  Please report any error
  messages that are encountered with a specific 'bug'.
