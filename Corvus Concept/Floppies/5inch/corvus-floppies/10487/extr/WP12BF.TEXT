eHBugs fixed in WordProc 1.2xe@

4/23/84

* Error in [Mark]/[Bound] caused SEARCH and REPLACE operations
  to proceed from the cursor point onwards, instead of being
  restricted to the bounded area.

* Another error in [Mark]/[Bound]... the line length for [Save]s
  was computed incorrectly when the left margin of the bounded
  area was not 1, causing the right ends of lines to be dropped.


4/25/84

* The [SaveFile] command did not properly check for I/O errors,
  and would cheerfully report "File saved" when it was, in fact,
  not, due to such things as too little volume space.

4/26/84

* Hack in PRNT module to turn enhancements off at the ends of lines
  when spooling from WordProc directly; additional form feed sent
  at the end of printing.


5/13/84

* A string range error would occur is the title of an IPC field was
  longer than 20 chars in the [Lists] mode. Fixed so that only the
  first 20 characters are considered.

[InsertFile] clobbers the first five blanks on a line, if the line
starts with blanks.
