                   eABeta Release WordProce@


     This is WordProc 1.2. Virtually all known bugs not
related to enhanced character editing have been fixed.  The
next release of WordProc will be version 2.0, with an
integrated spelling checker and other goodies.  No schedule
for this one yet.
     In no particular order, the changes, bug fixes, and
enhancements to version 1.1d/1.1 Special are as follows:

Now is the time for all goodjjjj jjj jjj
  men to come to the aid of their
  countries.
  eHNow is the time e@    dddd
This isn't underlined.

     eAWorde@ eAwrape@ eAworkse@ eAcorrectly.  e@ Previously, it would wrap
wordseA as eAthough the right margin was one position less than
eAit really was.

     eAWorkspacee@ eAdirectoriese@ eAaree@ eAinviolate.e@ There is no way I
know of to clobber a directory.  The mysterious blank lines
that would show up are no more (although if you have a in the
directory, you should save all the files and recreate it).
The [MoveText] menu is disabled for directories, and you
cannot type over the names of the MOMDIR, CURDIR, COPY, or
PRINT workpads.

     eAMark/bounde@ eAerrore@ eAfixed.e@ The range error that would
sometimes crop up during a [Mark]/[Bound][Save] operation has
been fixed.
     eASinglee@ eAsheete@ eAprintinge@ eAsimplified.e@ You can now print any
portion of a document in single sheet mode- just press
[SglSheet] in the [Print] menu.  The .SF dot command is still
limited in that it will (obviously) not take effect if it is
not in the text being printed.  Note that a .CF command will
eHalwayse@ countermand the single sheet option.

     eAEnhancemente@ eAprintinge@ eAprobleme@ eAfixed.e@ Enhancements are
always turned off at the end of a printed line, eliminating
the problems that sometimes cause large portions of a
document to be printed with (unwanted) enhancements.



     eAFormse@ eAerrore@ eAfixed.e@ The spacing errors sometimes
encountered when printing forms have been fixed.
     eAPrinte@ eAbuge@ eAfixed.e@ Some errors in print operations- such
as mysterious ".END" symbols- have been fixed.
     eAEditListe@ eAbuge@ eAfixed.e@ The bug that caused the system to
crash when an ALT character was typed in [EditList] has been
fixed.
     eAFramee@ eAlabelse@ eAconsistent.e@ The "frame labels", those
little inverse video flags in the command window that let you
know what part of the system you're in, are now always
displayed.

     eAGotoe@ eAoperatione@ eAchanged.e@ [Goto] now moves the entire
screen, instead of a three line window.

     eAReplacee@ eAoperatione@ eAchanged.e@ The operation of [Replace]
has been changed.  Previously, [Replace] would always start
looking at the beginning of a workpad.  Now, it proceeds from
the cursor point forwards.  If you want to replace all
occurrences of a string in a document, but still return to
your starting point, use the sequence [Mark] [Goto] [First-
Ln] [Search] [Replace] (whatever) [Goto] [GotoMark].

eAInserte@ eAtogglee@ eAoperational.e@ Pressing [Ins Char] again now
resets Typeover mode.

eAAutomatice@ eAreturne@ eAtoe@ eAmaine@ eAmenue@ eAlevel.e@ Previously, if you were
in some sections of the program such as [Document] or [Ad-
just], typing text (as you might do if you forgot to exit
the level) would cause only a beep.  Now, if you type a text
character, the system assumes you're finished with whatever
you were doing and drops you back to the main menu level.

eAShortcutse@ eAtoe@ eAenhancements.e@ Many people expressed a desire to
more easily access the often used boldface and underline
enhancements.  Now, pressing <Control>-U toggles underline
on and off, and pressing <Control>-B toggles boldface on and
off.  The standard [Enhance] menu still works, of course,
and enhancements set with this "shortcut" method will
reflect in the "Enhancements Set" display in [Enhance].

eAEasye@ eAaborte@ eAofe@ eAfilee@ eAsaves.e@ Pressing the BREAK key will abort
file saves and remove the partial file.  Note that if a file
already exists on a volume, an aborted save will leave the
original file intact, as it is not erased until the new file
is closed.

eAEasye@ eAaborte@ eAofe@ eAprinte@ eAoperations.e@ There are two ways to abort
a print operation.  Pressing BREAK while formatting is going
on will abort the print and clear the PRINT workpad.  After
formatting has occurred, you can use the [ABORT] key in the
[Print] menu to do the same thing.  Note that since many
printers have large buffers for received text, this does
eHnote@ necessarily mean that printing will stop instantly- just
that the Concept will stop sending characters.  A limitation
of this is that aborting a direct spool will leave an open
pipe; use the Const II utilities to delete it.

eACleare@ eAcopye@ eAbuffere@ eAimplemented.e@ In response to popular de-
mand, there is a "Clear Copy Buffer" option in the [Move-
Text] menu.  Just press [F3].

eALargee@ eAdocumente@ eAprinting.e@ The printing of very large docu-
ments (i.e.  over 125K total length) is now handled more
gracefully.  eHNote:e@ Documents that fall in this class can tie
the Concept up for a long time, since no editing will be
possible until the last line has been written to the PRINT
workpad.

eAEditinge@ eApossiblee@ eAine@ eA[Search].e@ You can now type while in the
[Search] menu, which makes correcting small errors much
easier.

eASorte@ eAremoved.e@ [Sort] is gone from the [Lists] and [Mark]/
[Bound] e@menus.  The WordProc sort was very slow, and would
(admittedly rarely) turn your workpad to dogfood...and
[Undo] was unimplemented since [Sort] required so many
operations (you would have had to press [Undo] a eHlote@ to
cancel a [Sort]).  The workpad structure used in WordProc
makes a quick sort almost impossible; use the [SortFile] key
in ISYS.  It's more than 40 times faster than the WordProc
sort, anyway.  eHNote:e@ Since the sort routine was used to sort
the workspace directory, directories will no longer be in
alphabetical order- workpads will appear in the order they
were created.

eAProgramminge@ eAmode.e@ A new option, Programming Mode, has been
added to the [Settings] menu.  Programming Mode changes some
of the operational characteristics of WordProc to make it
a more congenial environment for programmers.  These changes
are:
.nj


  1. Auto indent is always active:  pressing [Re-
     turn] will always cause the cursor to return
     to a position immediately below the first
     character of the previous line.

  2. Moving through a document by pressing [Re-
     turn] will position the cursor on the first
     character of each line as you go.

  3. Comments- i.e., all text between { and }, is
     automatically in boldface, UNLESS the first
     character after the opening brace is a dollar
     sign (for compiler directives).

  4. Insert Mode is left on during all movement
     operations.  You may move the cursor,
     scroll, and perform [Goto] operations without
     turning it off.  Any other function key (or
     [Ins Char]) will reset typeover mode.


eAGenerale@ eANotese@

Few people use subdirectories since they could not, until
recently, be deleted.  Effective with WordProc 1.1, subdirec-
tories can be deleted if they're empty.  Intelligent use of
subdirectories can make your workspace much neater, espe-
cially if you routinely use large workspaces.

The [LoadTabs] and [SaveTabs] functions in the [Settings]
menu makes it possible for each workpad to have its own
margin/tab settings.  The methodology I use is to create a
tab rack with the same name as the workpad.  WordProc 2.0
will make this automatic.


eAUndocumented things you may not have known about:e@

WordProc can include other workpads in a [Print] operation.
The dot command syntax is:

       .IN <name>

where <name> is the name of the workpad (eHnote@ a text file) to
be included in the printout.


Many users have requested a way to temporarily stop printing
to allow printwheel changes on letter quality printers.
Effective with WordProc 1.1, there is a command that allows
this: the "\\pause" command.

During a print operation, if WordProc sees this string imbed-
ded in the text, printing will stop, and the same "printing
paused..." message that occurs in single sheet feed mode
will appear to alert the user.  At this time a printwheel
can be changed, and [Print] [Continue] pressed to resume
printing.  eHNote:e@ Some printers will not print a line until a
carriage return has been received.  Obviously, this command
will not work correctly on these printers.


eALatee@ eAnotes

I have changed the format of the system message file.  Cur-
rently, only WordProc and LookUp use the system message file
(this is the data file SYSMSG).  However, LookUp has not
been recoded yet; so, temporarily, WordProc uses a seperate
version of SYSMSG called WPSYSMSG.  eHBoth this and eHthe eHstan-e@
eHdard SYSMSG file must be on your system.e@ LookUp will be up-
graded to handle the new system message file structure (and,
I might add, files of any size) in the near future.

This version of WordProc is eHnote@ a release but is a Beta test
version.  There may be have been new bugs introduced, al-
though I'm not aware of any.  Do eHnote@ call customer service
with problems and questions on this version of WordProc;
call me directly- (408) 559-7000 ext.  4628.

I would also like to take this opportunity to add that writ-
ten bug reports and comments are MUCH better than phone-ins.
Soon, I hope to have a Concept-run bulletin board system
that will allow customers to call in and leave messages, but
for now...

eAFilese@ eAincludede@ eAwithe@ eAthise@ eArelease:e@


eHWordProc 1.2e@
.nj

CC.WP-    Main WordProc file; goes on the /ISYS volume.
WPSYSMSG- Special system message file for CC.WP. Can go
          on either /CCSYS or /ISYS.
KEYS.ISYS- New function key labels. Replaces file of the
           same name on /CCSYS.


eHSpelling checker
e@
DMS-      Dictionary management system. This is the
          spelling checker that will be built into a
          future version of WordProc. No documentation,
          but the operation should be fairly obvious.
          Currently, it can only work on text files,
          so you must [Save] a workpad as a text file
          before running it. Any changes made to the
          text file by DMS will eHnote@ be reflected by
          the workpad until you [Load] the file back
          in. Goes on /ISYS.

VSI.DICTIONARY- This is the dictionary file used by
                DMS. It is small (although it will
          grow as you use it), and is eHnote@ guaranteed
          to be free if misspelled words! This file
          can go anywhere but DMS will not find it
          unless it's on the default volume when DMS
          is called. This file can grow to amazing
          size; you should put it where there's lots
          of space.

eHPrinter support

eANote:e@ You may already have these files; if the dates
      on your files match these dates, then you do
      not need to replace them.

CC.SETDCP- Replaces file of same name on /CCSYS.
DRV.EPRNT- Ditto.
BLDALT-    Replaces file of same name on /CCUTIL.
BLDACT-    Ditto.

Printer action tables and alternate character tables created
under the old system eHwill not worke@ with these files; you
must recreate them with the new utilities. More complete
documentation can be found in the file READ.ME.TEXT on the
enclosed disk(s).

eANotese@ eAone@ eAversion 1.3e@

Believe it or not, there were even some bugs lurking in
version 1.2! The ones that have since been squashed are:


4/23/84

* Error in [Mark]/[Bound] caused SEARCH and REPLACE opera-
tions to proceed from the cursor point onwards, instead of
being restricted to the bounded area.

* Another error in [Mark]/[Bound]...  the line length for
[Save]s was computed incorrectly when the left margin of the
bounded area was not 1, causing the right ends of lines to
be dropped. Fixed.


4/25/84

* The [SaveFile] command did not properly check for I/O er-
rors, and would cheerfully report "File saved" when it was,
in fact, not, due to such things as too little volume space.

4/26/84

* Hack in PRNT module to turn enhancements off at the ends
of lines when spooling from WordProc directly; additional
form feed sent at the end of printing. This cures a prob-
lem that would crop up at odd times: large portions of doc-
uments being printed with enhancements (i.e. underlines,
boldface) where only plain text should appear.

5/13/84

* A string range error would occur if the title of an IPC
field was longer than 20 chars in the [Lists] mode.  Fixed
so that only the first 20 characters are considered.


eAFinale@ eAnotee@ eAone@ eAcommunications...e@

Due to the absurd number of phone calls I've been getting,
my phone is now eHpermanentlye@ forwarded to the message center,
which means you can no longer call and get me directly.
Hopefully, this will let me get some work done during
business hours. I get groups of messages four times per day
and will get back to you ASAP.
