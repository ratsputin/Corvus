                     BURN-IN CHANGE DOCUMENT

                           REVISION E3



DATE: DEC. 6, '82


       Change made to OBMSTR & OBINT to permanently record the
number of "INVALID REPORTS" received during the burn-in run for
each disk.  The older revision, E2, cleared the count when a
valid report was received.

       The display for number of invalid reports was moved over
to prevent a collision with a large number of seeks.
